# Physical AI Constitution

## Vision
To be the go-to resource for beginners and intermediate learners to get started with Physical AI, with a focus on hands-on learning. Our goal is to demystify AI and make it accessible to everyone through practical, project-based tutorials.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On First
Every concept must be taught through practical, real-world examples. We prioritize learning by doing over theoretical explanations. Tutorials should guide the user through building a tangible project from start to finish.

### II. Beginner-Friendly Content
All documentation, tutorials, and examples must be written for a beginner to intermediate audience. We avoid jargon where possible and explain complex topics in simple, clear language. Code should be well-commented and easy to understand.

### III. Docusaurus for Documentation
All documentation will be built and maintained using Docusaurus. This ensures a consistent, searchable, and user-friendly documentation site.

## Success Criteria
- **High-Quality Tutorials:** Our success is measured by the quality of our educational content. Tutorials must be accurate, up-to-date, and easy to follow.
- **Positive Community Feedback:** We actively listen to our community and use their feedback to improve our content and platform.
- **Growing Contributor Base:** A healthy, growing number of open-source contributors is a sign that we are building a valuable and welcoming project.

## Constraints
- **Focus on Docusaurus:** The official documentation site must be built with Docusaurus to maintain a unified structure.
- **Content Accessibility:** All content, including text and visuals, must be accessible to a global audience with varying levels of ability.
- **Open Source:** The project and its content must remain open source under a permissive license (e.g., MIT).

## Stakeholders
- **Beginner & Intermediate AI Learners:** Our primary audience.
- **Educators & Mentors:** Those who use our content to teach others.
- **Open-Source Contributors:** The community that helps build and maintain the project.
- **Industry Partners:** Companies or individuals who may sponsor or collaborate on projects.

## Brand Voice
- **Approachable & Encouraging:** Our tone should be welcoming, friendly, and supportive. We want to empower learners, not intimidate them.
- **Clear & Concise:** We communicate with clarity and precision, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- **Authoritative & Trustworthy:** While friendly, our content is well-researched and accurate, establishing us as a reliable source of information.

## Governance
This Constitution is the supreme governing document of the Physical AI project. All project activities, contributions, and documentation must align with its principles. Amendments require a formal proposal, community review, and a clear migration plan for any affected content.
